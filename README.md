# Music Mood Classifier
This project is a Music Mood Classifier that uses machine learning techniques to classify songs based on their mood. The classifier analyzes audio features and metadata to determine whether a song is angry, happy, relaxed, or sad.
## Features
- Utilizes audio feature extraction techniques
- Implements machine learning algorithms for classification
- Classifies songs into different mood categories
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Music-Mood-Classifier.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Music-Mood-Classifier
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset of songs with labeled moods.
2. Preprocess the audio files and extract features using the scripts from dataset_creation_organization_codes directory.
3. Run the training script to train the mood classifier using the scripts and notebooks from training_codes directory.
4. Use the classifier to predict the mood of new songs.
